![Design preview for the REST Countries API with color theme switcher coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a good understanding of JavaScript.**

**This is my Solution.** :trophy::trophy::trophy:

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*

## My Process
   I am planning to write a blog post/video about it soon!!!
   
## Built with
- HTML5
- CSS (Grid, flexbox and custom properties)
- Vanilla JS  (local storage, Arrow functions, Promises etc)
- Axios HTTP Library

## What I learned
- Performing JS logic in JS template literals
- Custom routing
- CSS tricks like multiple class selectors

## Continued Development
 The next time I want to implement this project by using
 - React styled components, custom hooks and routers

## Useful resources

- [Multiple class selectors](https://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors/) - This helped me how to select multiple classes in the same element
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me in debugging process
